Project: "High clouds Airline Analysis âœˆ "

ðŸ“Œ Description:
This capstone project provides an in-depth analysis of High Cloud Airlines, aiming to improve the airlineâ€™s performance and make operations more efficient. It includes creating three interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, as well as using SQL queries to check data accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
1) To gain comprehensive understanding of "high cloud airlines " operations through data analysis.
2) Exploring other key metrics
3) Involve investigating load factor
4) Analyzing popular routes
5) Identifying top carrier names based on passenger preference

ðŸ“Š Methods Used:

âœ” Data Cleaning: Imported data from multiple sheets, cleaned it by renaming columns and adjusting data types, and checked for accuracy.

âœ” Data Connection & Modeling: Built data models in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and used SQL joins to link different tables.

âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculated key metrics like Load Factor (Total Passengers / Available Seats) and categorized days into weekdays and weekends.

âœ” Data Visualization: Created various charts (bar, line, KPI cards etc.) to show trends, relationships, and patterns. Used filters for date and location to analyze flights by origin and destination.

âœ” Reporting & Dashboarding: Made interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to show insights in real-time.

âœ” Cross-Verification with SQL: Used SQL queries to verify the accuracy of reportsÂ andÂ dashboards.

ðŸ’¡KPIs:
1) Calcuate the following fields:
   A. Year
   B. Monthno
   C. Monthfullname
   D. Quarter
   E. Year-Month ( YYYY-MMM)
   F. Weekdayno
   G. Weekdayname
   H. FinancialMOnth
   I. Financial Quarter 
2) Find the load Factor percentage on a yearly ,Quarterly ,Monthly basis. 
3) Find the load Factor percentage on a Carrier Name basis.
4) Identify Top 10 Carrier Names based passengers preference.
5) Display top Routes ( from-to City) based on Number of Flights.
6) Identify the how much load factor is occupied on Weekend vs Weekdays.
7) Identify number of flights based on Distance group.

ðŸ”ŽKey Findings:
1) Load factor shows how well an airline is filling its seats compared to competitors. Airlines use it to see where they stand in the market.
2) Airlines rely on load factor for planning routes, managing fleets, and making other strategic decisions.
3) In this analysis, 2013 had the highest load factor (17.40%), while 2009 had the lowest (15.66%). A higher load factor generally helps an airline make more money.
4) If an airline operates with a low load factor for too long, it can lose money. A high load factor usually boosts profits.
5) Delta Airlines has the highest load factor at 19.60%, with 28,837K transported passengers. Southwest Airlines transported 34,108K transported passengers with an 18.92% load factor.
6) Airlines with high load factors are seen as efficient and good at using their capacity to earn revenue.
7) Passengers often link busy flights with popular routes and may prefer airlines with higher load factors, seeing them as more reliable.
